This indicates that when one variable changes, the other variable changes proportionately.\nNormality: The errors are normally distributed\nEquality of variance: The variability of the response does not increase as the value of the predictor increases. Case Study\n\nLINE is a simple acroynm for remembering the assumptions of simple linear regression."

The dataset consists of information about the insurance buyers such as age, sex, BMI (body mass index), number of children, smoking habits and region. These variables serve as independent features, while the medical charges represent the dependent feature. The goal is to predict the medical charges based on the age of the individual.\n\nInstall packages\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") \n\npackage 'tidyverse' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\DOjekere\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpg7dB8F\\downloaded_packages\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\") \n\npackage 'readxl' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\DOjekere\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpg7dB8F\\downloaded_packages\n\n\n\n\nLoad the installed packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(readxl)\n\n\n\nLoad the datasets\n\nmedical_cost &lt;- read_csv(\"insurance.csv\")"

The R-squared value is 0.09 which means that 9% of the variation in charges can be explained by age.
